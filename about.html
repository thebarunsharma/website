		<h3>🏢LinkedIn</h3>
			<p>LinkedIn is the professional-y version of Facebook.LinkedInLinkedIn
			LinkedIn is a bit like Facebook for professional, business-y stuff.It gives me the idea that there are a lot of cool people with very much knowledge and expertise in different fields . And also a lot of recruiting gets done on it, and online PR is the most important thing now.</p>
		<h3>🤹SkillShare</h3>
			<p>Skillshare is the Netflix of courses. They have courses on photography, graphic design, music production, freelancing, and more than 20,000 courses at very low montly price and you even get  2-months free if you sign up using links . And all the courses have hands-on project to try. I personally used it to learn graphic design,  animation and web development. Skillshare was the best discovery during COVID and here are some of my favourites:</p>

			<h3>🚧Notion</h3>
			<p >It is the most flexible app I have ever used. It's mainly a note taking app but we can make Kanban style boards and calendars and also make *templates* . I use it to manage my life, studies. It can be also called as my *second brain.* I can switch from windows to Android and take all the college deadlines and assignments to information about running online courses.</p>
		<h3 >🗃️Anki</h3>
			<p >It is the best , minimal flashcard program out there. It syncs seamlessly with my phone and computer. I used it first for learning Spanish language which I am at a basic level now. And I used it for taking notes of short answers of Microprocessor in Third Semester. It is too satisfying to finish all the cards for the day.</p>
		<h3 >🎶Spotify</h3>
			<p >This technically doesn't count as a app but I use it to listen to songs especially <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4ETfiRPHVmUFLF6q0g8Fux#_=_" target="_blank">The Ultimate Study Music Playlist</a> when I am studying or learning. I also use it when I'm working or coding.</p>
